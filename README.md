# AutoTrade

> **Modular Python framework for designing and testing rule-driven trading ideas on historical market data.**  
> It includes core systems for price action analysis, support/resistance detection, and candlestick pattern recognition, all wired into a lightweight backtesting engine.  
> Built for flexibility, each component can be modified or swapped without breaking the rest of the pipeline.

## 1) General Overview

AutoTrade is a Python-based framework for developing and testing rule-driven trading systems on historical market data. It focuses on modular, readable code so that each trading concept is implemented as a separate, swappable component.

### System Additions & Changes

#### Candle and Candles Data Model
**What:** Introduced two core classes:  
- `Candle` ‚Äî represents a single OHLCV bar with helper methods for body size, wick lengths, and bullish/bearish status.  
- `Candles` ‚Äî manages collections of `Candle` objects converted from a DataFrame.  

**Change:** Moved away from direct pandas DataFrame manipulation for trading logic, instead wrapping data in an object-oriented interface.  

**Why:** To make logic easier to write, read, and reuse when iterating over historical data.

---

#### Support/Resistance System
**What:** Implemented functions in `price_action.py` to detect key price levels where reversals often occur. Includes proximity checks for when price approaches these levels.  

**Change:** Replaced the initial two-bar pattern logic with a system that calculates and stores S/R levels.  

**Why:** This established the first ‚Äúcore‚Äù technical structure system, moving from a simplistic signal toward a foundation for more complex rules.

---

#### Candlestick Pattern Recognition
**What:** Added detection for **engulfing** and **star** patterns in `price_action.py`.  

**Change:** Integrated these patterns alongside the existing S/R detection so they could be used together in strategies.  

**Why:** This was not part of the original plan, but was added after deciding that a working strategy would likely need confirmation beyond S/R levels.

---

#### Risk Management Utilities
**What:** Created `SL_TP.py` containing stop-loss and take-profit calculation helpers.  

**Change:** Integrated these with the backtesting strategy so entries could include defined exits.  

**Why:** These were designed for backtesting scenarios to simulate realistic trade management without implementing live trading logic.

---

#### Backtesting Framework Integration
**What:** Adopted the `backtesting` Python library, implemented a minimal `Strat` class in `Strat.py`, and created `backtest.py` to run it.  

**Change:** Replaced early manual test harnesses with a standard backtesting engine.  

**Why:** To allow consistent measurement of strategy performance and make it easier to plug in different logic modules.

---

#### Random Signal Generator
**What:** Added `random_signals.py` to produce placeholder buy/sell signals.  

**Change:** Connected it to the `Strat` class to verify the backtesting pipeline works end-to-end.  

**Why:** This was used purely for testing the system before integrating real trading logic.

```

### Contributing
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern.
- Add/expand docstrings and inline comments for clarity.
- Where possible, prefer pure functions for testability.
- Include a minimal reproducible example (MRE) for any bug fix.

### Roadmap (suggested next steps)
- Add **session logic** (Asia / London / NY AM / NY PM) tagging to candles.
- Implement **level retest flags** (e.g., prior session high/low hit again).
- Provide a standardized **metrics report** (win rate, PF, DD) after backtests.
- Optional: integrate **ib_insync** to fetch MNQ futures for multi‚Äëyear tests.
